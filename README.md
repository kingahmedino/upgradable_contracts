This repo contains the implementation of an upgradable contract using a Proxy contract and the different versions of its implementation contracts using delegatecall()

- Proxy contract: https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x5121A04d0952c6602B1A4311592116f0B0d94EfB#code
- Implementation V1: https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0xA8E1EC21d33CE5a2469Fb83bd1fd5F9307Eeeb92#code

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
